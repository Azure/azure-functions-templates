# DaprServiceInvocationTrigger - PowerShell

Using `Dapr Service Invocation Trigger`, your azure functions can reliably and securely communicate with other applications using the standard HTTP protocol.

## How it works

`Dapr Service Invocation Trigger` uses Dapr's API to invoke other services, and Dapr's sidecar handles routing, protocol translation, and retries, streamlining cross-service interaction.
