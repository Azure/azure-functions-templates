# SQL Input Binding - C<span>#</span>

The `SQL Input Binding` makes it easy to retrieve data from a database, returning the output of the query or stored procedure to the function.

## How it works

For a `SQL Input Binding` to work, you provide the existing object in the database to query. For instance, you can set the object to `[dbo].[table1]` to query this table.
