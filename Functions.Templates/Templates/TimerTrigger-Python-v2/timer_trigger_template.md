# Azure Functions: Timer Trigger in Python

## Timer Trigger

A timer trigger lets you run a function on a schedule.

## Using the Template

Following is an example code snippet for Timer Trigger using the [Python programming model V2](https://aka.ms/pythonprogrammingmodel) (currently in Preview).

```python
import datetime
import logging
import azure.functions as func
app = func.FunctionApp()
@app.function_name(name="mytimer")
@app.schedule(schedule="0 */5 * * * *", arg_name="mytimer", run_on_startup=True,
              use_monitor=False) 
def test_function(mytimer: func.TimerRequest) -> None:
    utc_timestamp = datetime.datetime.utcnow().replace(
        tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc).isoformat()
    if mytimer.past_due:
        logging.info('The timer is past due!')
    logging.info('Python timer trigger function ran at %s', utc_timestamp)
```

To run the code snippet generated through the command palette, note the following:

- The function application is defined and named `app`.
- Confirm that the parameters within the trigger reflect values that correspond with your storage account.
- The name of the file must be `function_app.py`.

## V2 Programming Model

The v2 programming model in Azure Functions Python delivers an experience that aligns with Python development principles, and subsequently with commonly used Python frameworks. 

To learn more about using the Python programming model for Azure Functions, see the [Azure Functions Python developer guide](https://aka.ms/pythondeveloperguide). Note that in addition to the documentation, [hints](https://aka.ms/functions-python-hints) are available in code editors that support type checking with PYI files.
