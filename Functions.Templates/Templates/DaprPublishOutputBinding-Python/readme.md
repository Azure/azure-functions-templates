# DaprPublishOutputBinding - Python

`Dapr Publish Output Binding` - Dapr's output binding feature enables you to publish messages to external messaging systems (such as message queues, event hubs, or other event-driven systems) as part of your application's workflow. It's a way to send data from your Dapr application to external services.

## How it works

In Dapr's pub-sub building block, the "publish" operation allows a Dapr-enabled application to send messages or events to a specific topic. When the application wishes to notify other components or services about an event or data update, it calls Dapr's publish API with the event data and the target topic. Dapr's sidecar takes care of delivering the message to all subscribed components, which can then react to the event as needed. This approach decouples the publisher from the subscribers, enabling a flexible, event-driven architecture where different parts of the application can independently react to and process events without direct dependencies on each other, fostering loose coupling and scalability.
