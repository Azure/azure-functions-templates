# MySql Input Binding - Typescript

The `MySql Input Binding` makes it easy to retrieve data from a database, returning the output of the query or stored procedure to the function.

## How it works

For a `MySql Input Binding` to work, you can provide the query to retrieve data from an existing object in the database. For instance, you can set the query to `SELECT * FROM table1` in the `commandText` value in your `function.json` to return all the values from the `table1` table in the database.
